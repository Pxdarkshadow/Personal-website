            <img src="images/1x1 my photo.JPG" alt="Shaun Mathew" class="profile-image">
            <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Shaun Mathew</strong>, a second-year engineering student at 
            <em>St. Francis Institute of Technology</em>.<br>
            I have a strong passion for <strong>coding</strong> and <strong>gaming</strong>, constantly exploring new technologies and building<br> 
            creative projects to sharpen my skills. I enjoy solving complex problems and often work on 
            <em>web development</em><br>and <em>software-based innovations</em>.
            Outside academics, I'm a dedicated gamer and tech enthusiast who<br>loves diving into immersive game worlds. 
            <strong>Fitness</strong> is also a big part of my lifestyle — I regularly hit<br>the gym to stay active and balanced.
            My technical toolkit includes <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>,<br> and <strong>SQLite3</strong>.
            I'm currently working toward a career in <em>software engineering</em>, with an interest in AI-powered<br>solutions 
            and human-computer interaction.
            I'm also part of our college's tech community, where I've led workshops<br>and mentored peers.
            I believe in <em>continuous learning</em>, whether it's through late-night coding sessions or<br>intense gym workouts.
            I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and push my boundaries — both mentally and physically.
            </p>
